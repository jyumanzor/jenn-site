## Logo Concepts to Explore

### 1. Monogram "J"
A stylized letter J that feels:
- Modern but not tech-bro
- Has movement (subtle nod to running)
- Works at small sizes (favicon, app icon)

**Prompt**: "Design a minimal monogram logo for the letter J. Style: editorial, magazine-quality. Colors: deep forest green (#3B412D) background with gold (#FABF34) accent. The J should have subtle movement suggesting forward motion. No gradients. Clean lines. Must work at 32x32 favicon size."

### 2. "Ji" Ligature
Combining J and i (for Jenn's initials or "Jenn intelligence")
- The dot of the i becomes a gold accent
- Suggests both personal brand and AI/intelligence work

**Prompt**: "Create a ligature logo combining letters J and i. The J curves into the i stem. The dot of the i is a gold (#FABF34) circle accent. Main letterforms in sage green (#97A97C) or forest green (#3B412D). Minimal, editorial style. No serif fonts - custom letterforms only."

### 3. Abstract Running Figure
A very abstracted runner form that doubles as a letter or symbol
- Single continuous line
- Suggests motion without being literal

**Prompt**: "Design an abstract logo that suggests a running figure using a single continuous line. The line should also subtly form the letter J. Colors: forest green (#3B412D) line on ivory (#FFF5EB) background, or reversed. Minimal, almost like a signature or brushstroke. No literal human figure - abstract only."

### 4. Data Point / Node
A mark that references both running (tracking/data) and consulting (analysis)
- Could be a stylized chart node or data point
- Gold accent as the "point of focus"

**Prompt**: "Create a minimal logo mark that combines a data visualization node/point with the letter J. The node (a small circle) is gold (#FABF34), connected to flowing lines in forest green (#3B412D) that form a J shape. Suggests data analysis and forward motion. Clean, modern, would work in a professional consulting context."

### 5. Pace Marker
Inspired by mile markers or pace indicators
- Simple geometric shape
- Contains or suggests "J"

**Prompt**: "Design a logo inspired by running mile markers or pace indicators. Incorporate the letter J subtly. Use a rounded rectangle or shield shape. Colors: forest green (#3B412D) with gold (#FABF34) accent. Should feel like a badge or marker you'd see on a running route. Minimal, not sporty."

## Style Guidelines for Any Concept

### DO:
- Keep it simple enough for favicon use (32x32)
- Use brand colors only
- Make it feel editorial/magazine quality
- Include subtle movement or forward direction
- Ensure it works on both dark and light backgrounds

### DON'T:
- Make it look like a fitness brand logo
- Use gradients or shadows
- Make it too literal (no running shoes, no stick figures)
- Use trendy startup aesthetics
- Include taglines or full name in the mark

## Usage Contexts

The logo needs to work for:
1. **Favicon** - 32x32, must be recognizable
2. **App icon** - iOS/Android style rounded square
3. **Header mark** - Next to "Jenn" or site title
4. **Standalone** - Social media profile, watermark
5. **Dark mode** - Must work on `#0F0F0F` or `#1A1A1A`
6. **Light mode** - Must work on `#FFF5EB` ivory

## Inspiration References

- Editorial magazine mastheads (The New Yorker, Kinfolk)
- High-end running brands (Tracksmith, Bandit Running)
- Data visualization aesthetics (clean, purposeful)
- Japanese design minimalism

## Prompts for AI Logo Generation

### For Claude/text-based:
"Describe in detail a logo concept for a personal brand called 'Jenn'. The person is an economics consultant and marathoner. The logo should be a minimal monogram or abstract mark that works at favicon size. Use these colors: forest green #3B412D, gold #FABF34, sage #97A97C. Style: editorial, refined, suggests forward motion. Describe the shapes, proportions, and how colors are used."

### For image generation (Midjourney/DALL-E):
"Minimal monogram logo letter J, editorial magazine style, forest green and gold colors, clean vector lines, subtle forward motion, works at small size, white background, professional brand mark --no text --no gradients --stylize 50"

### For iteration:
"Take this logo concept and make it: [simpler / more dynamic / work better at small sizes / feel more editorial / incorporate a subtle running reference]"
